      convert it to any currencies to meet trading needs on our APP.


      All options differ in exchange rate and transfer fee charged by banks. We
      recommend that clients do online banking transfers as there are no
      overseas wire fees and transactions normally take only one day to
      complete. Withdrawing funds is just as easy as making a deposit.
